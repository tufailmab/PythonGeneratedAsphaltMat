Prony Series Fitting for Viscoelastic Materials
This project provides a Python-based solution for fitting experimental relaxation modulus data to a Prony series model, commonly used for viscoelastic material simulations. The code also generates a .inp material file compatible with ABAQUS
Features
Curve Fitting: Fit experimental relaxation modulus data using a reduced-term Prony series.
Parameter Normalization: Ensures proper scaling of coefficients for reliable material models.
Automated ABAQUS File Generation: Outputs a ready-to-use .inp material file.
Visualization: Graphically compare experimental data and fitted curves.
